# Add Your Resume PDF Here

To make the download button work with your actual resume:

1. Save your resume as a PDF file
2. Name it exactly: `Dario_Jakovleski_Resume.pdf`
3. Place it in the `public` folder of your project:
   \`\`\`
   your-project/
   └── public/
       └── Dario_Jakovleski_Resume.pdf  ← Put your PDF here
   \`\`\`

4. The download button will automatically work once the file is there!

## Alternative: If you're deploying to Vercel

If you're working locally and want to test:
1. Download your actual resume PDF from wherever you have it saved
2. Add it to the public folder as described above
3. Restart your development server
4. Test the download button

The current code is ready - it just needs your actual PDF file!
